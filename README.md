# dhcp-lease-parser

### Overview
This repository is used to parse the DHCP lease file for CDE Lightbrand (Customer).
A DHCP lease is a temporary assignment of an IP address to a device on the network. When using DHCP to manage a pool of IP addresses, each client served on the network is only “renting” its IP address. Thus, IP addresses managed by a DHCP server are only assigned for a limited period of time.
